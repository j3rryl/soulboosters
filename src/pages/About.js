        Climate change: two small words that represent a radical transformation of our planet, billions of data points, millions of climate scientists and campaigners, and a limitless number of stories from around the world.

        <h5>The Plan</h5>
        <p>     
        To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced by half by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Bold, fast, and wide-ranging action needs to be taken by governments and businesses. 
        But the transition to a low-carbon world also requires the participation of citizens - especially in advanced economies.

        The African peoples of Kenya is divided into three language groups: Bantu, Nilo-Saharan, and Afro-Asiatic. 
        Bantu is by far the largest, and its speakers are mainly concentrated in the southern third of the country. The Kikuyu, Kamba, Meru, and Nyika peoples occupy the fertile Central Rift highlands, while the Luhya and Gusii inhabit the Lake Victoria basin.
